Used for crating objects in performance-intensive situations. Objects are
cloned from a prototype object to increase performance.

Basically, you start with a constructor object and add or subtract functions
and variables to it. The constructor is a parent object.

Revealing Prototype Pattern: Provides encapsulation with public and private
members since it returns an object literal.

It's a template.
